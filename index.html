        <h3>Take care of your emotional health: </h3>
          <p>
            Taking care of your emotional health will help you think clearly and react to the urgent need to protect yourself and your family.
      Take breaks and stop watching, reading, or listening to the news. This includes social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can affect you.
      Connect with your faith and community organizations. While social distancing measures have been put in place, consider connecting online, through social media, by phone, or by mail.

     <h3>Take care of your body.</h3>
      <p>
      Take deep breaths, stretching exercises, or meditation.
  Get regular exercise.
  Avoid excessive alcohol and drug use. Many people think of exercise as just being for weight loss but it does far more than that. It helps combat disease such as high blood pressure, depression, certain types of cancer, stroke, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.
